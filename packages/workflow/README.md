# @intx/workflow

Workflow definition surface, state machine, and abstract runtime
for multi-step agent workflows.

This package is host-agnostic. It exposes the data types that
describe a workflow, the state machine that interprets a run's
event log, and the abstract `WorkflowRuntimeEnv` the runtime body
takes its dependencies from. It does not know how a run is
persisted, scheduled, or spawned — those are the host's job.

Multi-entry exports:

- `@intx/workflow/definition` — `WorkflowDefinition`, `defineWorkflow`,
  `hashDefinition`, the `stepId` shape rule. The on-disk form a
  workflow lives in.
- `@intx/workflow/state-machine` — the event union, the transition
  function, the `RunState` projection. Pure functions over the
  workflow-run log.
- `@intx/workflow/runtime` — `runtimeRun` (the body that drives a run
  forward) plus the `WorkflowRuntimeEnv` interface every concrete
  host implements. The body switches on env keys; it never branches
  on the host process it runs in.
- `@intx/workflow/runlocal` — an in-memory adapter for tests. The
  scheduler, RepoStore, blob substrate, and spawn-child callback all
  exist purely in process memory so tests can drive the runtime
  without a substrate.

For a production host (workflow-run repo backing, scheduler that
honors wall-clock fire times, signal channel that observes commits,
DI seams for mail bus / signing key / subprocess spawner), see
`@intx/workflow-host`. For deploy-time validation, capability walk,
and the agent-deploy-trivial-workflow dichotomy, see
`@intx/workflow-deploy`.
